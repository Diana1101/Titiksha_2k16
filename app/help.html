its inception in 2008. Titiksha has grown in stature in terms of its content, infrastructure and

paramount importance.<br><br>We, at Titiksha, constantly strive towards the satisfaction of everyone. We shall leave no
stone unturned in fulfilling the needs of a secure accommodation away from home. Along
