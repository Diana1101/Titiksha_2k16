									<h3>Elcovision</h3>
									<p>ABOUT- only for 1 st year and 2nd year students
Totally based on electronics.
ROUND-1:
1] We will present 4 circuits at a time with their proper name witten below it for 30 sec{time may exceed to 40 sec}
2]We will give name of components to the participants and ask the circuit in which it was present{they can either write the name or number of the circuit}.
3]We will finalise top 5 participants on the basis of their right answer.
NOTE- A PEN AND A BLANK PAPER WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE PARTICIPANTS FOR DRAWING THE CIRCUIT(IF THEY WANT) WITHIN TIME LIMIT AND ALSO FOR WRITING THE ANSWER.
ROUND-2
1] 5 basic questions will be asked from the selected participants from round 1.Questions will be based on basic electronics.
2]1 st,2nd,3rd rankers will be decided on the answers.
                                                                               		ORGANISERS :–

									<h3>Electromania</h3>
									<p>TASK:
Every group will be given a couple of riddles.
Contents:
This event contains only 10 groups, each having minimum 2 students and max 3 students.
Event will be divided into 2 stages.
First stage:
Each group will be given a couple of riddles to solve. The solution of the riddles will the output of the circuit which they have to make.
Second stage :
Ones who will solve the riddles will be go to second stage only 3 groups will be there in second stage. In this, they have to design the ckt whose output will be solution of one of the riddles.this task has to be done on bread board.
Rules:
1. Every round is a timer round.
2. The completion of your task will be considered if and only if your ckt is working properly.
3. Total 10 team will participate. Out of these only 3 teams will go in 2nd round.

									<h3>Play with Arduino</h3>
									<p>Contents:-
This event contains only 20 groups, each having 3 students.
Event will be divided into three different stages.
First stage:
It is a Quiz round having 20 questions which has to be solve in 10 min’s. This Quiz consist of basic knowledge about Arduino board and its shields. Those who are clear first stage will be sent to next stage.
Second stage:
This is a timer round, First 6 group who complete the task in minimum time will be promoted for the final round. The Task will be given at that time. 
Third stage:
This is the final stage where each group has to solve their final problem by making their own codes to complete the task and assemble the connections on bread board.

Rules:
1) Every round is a timer round, so each group act fastly.
2) Each group should keep knowledge about Arduino kit and its software Arduino IDE .
3) If any group lost their components, the team will be disqualified.
4) The completion of your task will be considered if and only if your circuit is working properly.
5) In First stage 4 group will be eliminated and in second stage 2 group will be eliminated (it may be vary according to the participations ).

									<p>TASK: 
There are three rounds in this contest Participants have to complete the task given to qualify for the next round. 
CONTENTS:	
Event will be performed in THREE ROUNDS
FIRST ROUND:
We will show a simple circuit for a fraction of time with the help of projector and each group will require to draw the same circuit on paper, in a given time limit. 
SECOND ROUND:
The selected participants in the first round will be paired in a group. Every group will require to make the given circuit with the help of available hardware, and have to find out the proper output.
FINAL ROUND:
Selected group will require to draw the given circuit, and to show the proper output on MULTISIM software.
RULES: 
1. Every round will be time limited.
2. If any group is not familiar with MULTISIM then a team will be there to brief them.

									<h3>Technojam</h3>
									<p>This is a technical event in which the participants should have basic knowledge about electronics components. It will be conducted in two rounds/levels.
Round-1: 
The participants will be given a crossword to be solved on some technical words used in electronics and communication subject particularly. The participants who qualify this round will be promoted to the next round.
Round-2:
 The qualified participants will now be given a clue for finding the components which will be required to make a final circuit. The one with complete working circuit or maximum no. of components collected wins the event.

									<h3>RoboSoccer</h3>
									<p>Introduction
This event is a platform for participants to showcase their robotics talents and also to bring alive the football spirit. They are required to build two manually controlled bots capable of playing soccer on an arena specially designed for the robotic soccer match.

Objective
To build two manually controlled bots capable of playing soccer on an arena specially designed for robotic soccer match. The event is aimed at testing flipping and hitting of ball and bot control.
The bots should be controlled using laptops or pc’s only. Use of DPDT switches and controllers is not allowed.
For communication with computer both wired or wireless communication may be used.
Note:Teams have to bring their own laptops for the competition.
